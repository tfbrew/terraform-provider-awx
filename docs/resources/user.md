# awx_user (Resource)

Manage an Automation Controller user.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awx_user" "example" {
  username     = "example"
  password     = "test1234"
  first_name   = "test"
  last_name    = "user"
  email        = "test@example.com"
  is_superuser = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `password` (String) User's password. If the password is updated in automation controller, due to the api, terraform will not know that it has been changed.
- `username` (String) The username of the user.

### Optional

- `email` (String) User's email.
- `first_name` (String) User's first name.
- `is_superuser` (Boolean) Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them. Only one of `is_superuser` or `is_system_auditor` is allowed.
- `is_system_auditor` (Boolean) AWX/AAP2.4 only. User is a system wide auditor. Only one of `is_superuser` or `is_system_auditor` is allowed. AAP 2.5 changes this attribute to `is_platform_auditor`, but the API to set that to true does not work.
- `last_name` (String) User's last name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The password field contains values that are not returned by the automation controller API and thus not available in state.
# The first plan/apply after import will result in a modification to the password so that the state can be updated.

terraform import awx_user.example 1
```
