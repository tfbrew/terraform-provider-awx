# awx_credential (Resource)

Manage an Automation Controller credential. 
NOTE: The automation controller API does not return encrypted secrets so changes made in the controller of the inputs field will be ignored. 
The only changes to the inputs field that will be sent are when the terraform code does not match the terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "awx_organization" "example" {
  name        = "tf_example"
  description = "example"
}

// Example machine credential

// Inputs options for machine credentials:
// username, password, ssh_key_data, ssh_public_key_data, become_method, become_password, ssh_key_unlock
// Setting a value to "ASK" is equal to choosing "Prompt at Launch"

data "awx_credential_type" "machine" {
  name = "Machine"
  kind = "ssh"
}

resource "awx_credential" "example-machine" {
  name            = "example_machine"
  organization    = awx_organization.example.id
  credential_type = data.awx_credential_type.machine.id
  inputs = jsonencode({
    "become_method" : "sudo",
    "become_password" : "ASK", // ASK = Prompt at Launch checkbox
    "password" : "test1234",   // code should not contain secrets, example only
    "username" : "awx"
  })
}

// Example source control credential

// Inputs options for source control credentials:
// username, password, ssh_key_data, ssh_key_unlock
// Setting a value to "ASK" is equal to choosing "Prompt at Launch"

data "awx_credential_type" "source-control" {
  name = "Source Control"
  kind = "scm"
}

resource "awx_credential" "example-source-control" {
  name            = "example_machine"
  organization    = awx_organization.example.id
  credential_type = data.awx_credential_type.source-control.id
  inputs = jsonencode({
    "ssh_key_data" : file("${path.module}/id_rsa"), // code should not contain secrets, example only
    "ssh_key_unlock" : "test1234",                  // code should not contain secrets, example only
    "username" : "awx"
  })
}

// Example container registry credential

// Inputs options for source control credentials:
// host, username, password, verify_ssl
// Setting a value to "ASK" is equal to choosing "Prompt at Launch"

data "awx_credential_type" "container-registry" {
  name = "Container Registry"
  kind = "registry"
}

resource "awx_credential" "example-container-registry" {
  name            = "example_container_registry"
  organization    = awx_organization.example.id
  credential_type = data.awx_credential_type.container-registry.id
  inputs = jsonencode({
    "host" : "quay.io",
    "password" : "test1234", // code should not contain secrets, example only
    "username" : "test",
    "verify_ssl" : true
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `credential_type` (Number) ID of the credential type.
- `name` (String) Credential name.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Credential description.
- `inputs` (Dynamic, Sensitive) This field can take inputs in two forms. The first is by providing an object. If importing, it expects your input value to be an object. See above for examples of both types. The older, second method is to specify a string by using using `jsonencode() to encode similar data as as string in state.`. Specify alphabetically when using the second method.
- `organization` (Number) ID of organization which owns this credential. One and only one of `organization`, `team`, or `user` must be set.
- `team` (Number) ID of team which owns this credential. One and only one of `organization`, `team`, or `user` must be set.
- `user` (Number) ID of user which owns this credential. One and only one of `organization`, `team`, or `user` must be set.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Credential ID.
- `kind` (String) Credential kind.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The inputs field contains values that are not returned by the automation controller API and thus not available in state.
# The first plan/apply after import will result in a modification to the inputs so that the state can be updated.

terraform import awx_credential.example 5

# If you have an inputs_with_import field defined with secrets, you need to specify them here as comma-separated field name and secret-value pairs.
# The string at the end of this example command below would correlate to:
#   resource "awx_credential" "example_with_input" {
#      id = 5   
#      inputs_with_import = {
#         password = "12345"
#         token = "token,a1b2c3-d4e5"
#         non-secret = "do not include in import cli command"
#      }
#   }

terraform import awx_credential.example_with_input "5,password,12345,token,a1b2c3-d4e5"
```
